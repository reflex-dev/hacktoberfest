# 🎃 Reflex Hacktoberfest Competition 🎃
Welcome to the Reflex hacktoberfest competition!


## 🤔 What to Build

There will be a $100 prize for the best app in each of the four categories and a $50 prize for the second best app in each cetegory. In addition, all apps submitted and accepted will receive a month of free hosting when this feature is released. 

## How to Submit Your Project
1. Git clone this repo
2. Create your own branch using `git checkout -b name_of_your_branch`
3. cd into the submissions folder and then into the folder for the category for which you would like to build your app.
4. Create a folder with the name of your project (please start this folder name with your name)
5. Build your app in this folder
6. When your app is finished create a PR into the main branch
7. Please ensure each project has a thorough ReadMe that describes what your project does, how to run it (you can only select one category to compete in per app).

## Share your Work
Once your app is finished please share it on the [Showcase channel](https://discord.com/channels/1029853095527727165/1063735841333198938) on our Discord, with a demo video of how your app works. We will add apps to our community gallery channel.
